# Perceptual Load and Attention Experiment

Looking at selective attention under perceptual load. 

Circle of 6 letters, and one letter outside circle (distractor). Task is to press one mouse button if you see the letter X in the circle and another if you see the letter N in the circle (buttons counterbalanced across participants). 

_Perceptual Load_: High Load/Low Load determined by whether the rest of the letters (apart from X or N) in the circle are all O (low load) or a mix of letters (high load).

_Distractor_: The letter outside the circle is either Congruent to the one in the circle (e.g. N when target letter is N, Incongruent (e.g. X when target letter is N) or neutral (the letter L). Distractor equally likely to be on right and left of circle. 

_Cueing_: On some trials, the circle of letter is preceded by an arrow which will point to the target letter. On other trials, there is just a fixation cross. Cue Trial: Fixation cross for 800ms, Arrow for 200ms; Uncued Trial: Fixation cross for 1000ms.

_Experiment structure_

12 slow training trials (fixation 1s, letter 3.5s)

24 normal speed training trials (fixation 1s, letter 100ms [in 3.5s response window]) 

6 blocks of 144 trials (same speed as above, 72 trials per experimental combination (Load [High/Low], Distractor [Congruent/Incongruent/Neutral], Cueing [Cued/Uncued]). NB: 18 trials per possible combination if add in Letter [X/N] and distractor position [Left/Right].
