# CIT Nogo3 Imagery

A modified response-priming paradigm employed in stroke patients presenting with chronic low function upper-limb hemiparesis, whilst EEG was recorded. Motor Imagery version of CIT Nogo3

NB: No Invalid trials, only neutral (ambiguous) trials. And added No Response Trials (all Valid)

NB: No Responses required. Participants prepare response as per typical task (CIT Nogo3), but then perform kinesthetic motor imagery of button press. 

EMG recorded from forearms to rue out overt movement. 

Same Setup as for CIT Nogo3.
