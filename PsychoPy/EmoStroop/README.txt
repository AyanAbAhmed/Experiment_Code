Emotional Stroop

This experiment initially presents a round of classic stroop training, and then presents and emotional stroop task.
In each case, the colour of the word presented is indicated using the arrow keys. Feedback (correct/incorrect) is given after every trial. 
In the classic stroop, there are three colour/word combinations red, blue, green. Colour and word is congruent on 33 % of trials, and incongruent on 66 % of trials. 
There are 90 trials in this block. 
In the emotional stroop colour is combined with an emotional valenced word; positive, negative or neutral condition*
For each valence condition, there are 60 trials split into 3 blocks. Block presentation is randomised.  
For each stimulus, there is a matched scrambled equivalent. These again are 60 per condition, presented randomly within-block with the unscrambled stimuli. 
Each block presents 40 trials of scrambled or unscrambled stimuli, and for each condition, blocks are presented 3 times with unique stimuli in each.  

Block presentation is interleaved [0 back, 2 back, 0 back, 2 back, 0 back, 2, back]. 
In the 0 back condition, a target is assigned (from a range of 1-9) and presented 33 % of the time. 
In the 2 back condition, a targets are generated (from a range of 1-9) and presented 33 % of the time.
