# CIT Short Behavioural Nogo 3

A modified response-priming paradigm employed in stroke patients presenting with chronic low function upper-limb hemiparesis.

NB: 80% Valid prime; 20% Invalid Prime

Prime Right, Prime Left and Prime No Response only.

_Experiment setup:_

    Three white priming stimuli (S1) presented within an empty line-drawn white circle on a black background: 

      Left Prime (<<), Right Prime (>>),  or No Response Prime (><)

    Followed by one of three possible response stimuli (S2), represented by a white semicircle appearing within the line-drawn circle

      left button (left white semicircle), right button (right white semicircle) or no button (bottom white semicircle)

    Left and Right Primes predict response correctly (Valid) 80% of the time, and incorrectly (Invalid) 20% of the time (20% respond with opposite hand)

    No Response Prime predict response correctly (Valid) 80% of the time, and incorrectly (Invalid) 20% of the time (10% left button, 10% right button)

Right and left prime trials (67%; Prime left-valid [27%], Prime right-valid [27%], Prime left-invalid [7%], Prime right-invalid [7%]) are equally likely.

No response prime trials half as likely (33%; Prime No Response-valid [27%], Prime NoResponse-Left [3%], Prime NoResponse-Right [3%])

All trial types are randomised within each block.
